# Authentication system using MERN

## Description
The developed application is a secure authentication system using the MERN stack, where users are assigned an access token and a refresh token. The access token serves as a means of authentication, granting the user access to the application. Meanwhile, the refresh token is used to renew an expired access token. The system encompasses all essential authentication functionalities, such as login, registration, and logout. Additionally, it includes role-based authorization as well as resetting the forgotten password via email.<br /><br /> 

The creation of this project is motivated by my technical blog hosted on [Hashnode](https://blog.danylkecha.com). I have published a blog post that offers a detailed step-by-step guide covering every aspect of the project, beginning with the initial setup and concluding with the final version of the application. <br /><br />
This tutorial intends to provide a comprehensive resource for readers interested in learning and implementing authentication using MERN.<br /><br />
